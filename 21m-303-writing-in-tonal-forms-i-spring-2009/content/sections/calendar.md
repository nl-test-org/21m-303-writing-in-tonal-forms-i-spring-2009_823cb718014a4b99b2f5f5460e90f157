Compare the english and the German versions of An Sylvia {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 13 | Readings of your Minuets by \[an anonymous professional string quartet\] in Killian Hall. Bring at least 3 copies of the score (1 is for me), and a good, clean set of parts |
| 14 |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Analyze the key relationships in Gretchen am Spinnrade. What is the harmony at the climax ("Und ach! sein Kuß!")? How does Schubert arrive at this chord? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Familiarize yourself with Schubert, Die schöne Müllerin, nos. 7-10. Remember always to compare the text with the music. How well does strophic form capture the expressive qualities of the poetry? What makes the music expressive, in spite of the repetition? {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 15 |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Familiarize yourself with songs 7, 8, and 10 in Die Schöne Müllerin. Analyze the harmony, phrase structure, relationship between the text and the music. In 'Ungeduld,' how does Schubert convey an impression of impatience? In 'Moregengruss,' what is the function of the chromatic harmonies in mm. 12-15? In 'Thränenregen,' how do you explain Schubert's different treatment of the last stanza? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Begin identifying potential texts for your song composition. You will need to bring 2 choices to the next class. You may choose from the sample romantic poems provided, or simply use these as models for your own choices {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |

| 17 |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Begin work on your song. Sketch parts of your vocal line and ideas for a piano accompaniment. Write a piano introduction {{< br >}}{{< br >}} In addition, familiarize yourself with Schumann's Dichterliebe, Nos. 1-7. You'll find that the songs are full of enigma: What key is the first song in? Where do phrases end in song 2 _(Aus meinen Tra![](/courses/music-and-theater-arts/21m-303-writing-in-tonal-forms-i-spring-2009/calendar/trainword.jpg) en sprießen)?_ Where is the climax in song 4 _(Wenn ich in deine Augen seh')_? What is the opening chord in song 5 _(Ich will meine Seele tauchen)_, and what is its effect? What modifications does Schumann make to Heine's poem in Song 7 _(Ich grolle nicht)_ and what effect does this have on the musical form? {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 18 | By the end of the week, a final draft of your song should be emailed to Janna Baty and Daniel Curtis. Remember to include the poem in your attachment, and to write your name and the title of the composition at the head of every page. (Also include a polite message to the musicians in the body of your email) |
| 19 | Song readings with Janna Baty and Daniel Curtis, at Killian Hall. Bring three hard copies of your work to the reading: one for you, one for me, and a backup |
| 20 |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Familiarize yourself with the 2 Wolf songs in your collection. How useful is roman numeral analysis for understanding this music? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} You will also have an opportunity to do your course evaluation today, and to discuss Monday's song readings, future courses, and other topics that might be on your mind {{< br >}}{{< br >}}
